# Console Do Not Track Source File
This is inspired by [consoledonottrack.com](https://consoledonottrack.com). It implements the proposed `DO_NOT_TRACK` variable, along with other service specific ones. Please have a read of that website to find out more.

I'll add new variables as I hear about them, and please feel free to contribute a pull request if I'm missing any.

## Usage
Once you've cloned this repository, simply source `console-do-not-track.sh` from your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. Eg:

```bash
source '~/github/ConsoleDoNotTrack/console-do-not-track.sh'
```
